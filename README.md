# Deep Learning Journey

This repository achieves these items I practiced along in understanding deep learning.

Most of the code examples are actually from Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree but with my own solutions and some comments. The reason why I can post them here is Udacity is so generous that it already open-sourced all of the code materials here and encouraged us to submit our projects assignments via Github. 

Here is the Udacity course Github link: https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning

I am posting up my assignment solutions and some other codes I practiced and found useful to document my learnings and hopefully, you may find them beneficial as well. However, if you are also a student enrolling this program, please do not directly copy the answer here. You are learning something which will accompany you for the rest of your life. Don't be lured by the seemingly easier path. Go get headaches yourself and when you are done, comparing mine or Udacity's solution to uncover different solutions for the same problem.

# Deep-Learning-Journey

This repository achieve these items I practiced along in understanding deep learning.

Most of the code examples are actually from Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree but with my own solutions and some comments. The reason why I can post them here is Udacity is so generous that it already open-sourced all of the code materials on Github. I will provid the links later. They also encourage us to submit our projects assignments via Github. 

I am posting up my assignments and some other codes I practiced and found useful to document my learnings and hopefully, you may find them beneficial as well.

# Deep Learning Journey

This repository achieves these items I practiced along in understanding deep learning.

Most of the code examples are actually from Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree but with my own solutions, some practices and comments. To get the most of this program, after finishing each part of study, I examined most of the exercise codes written by Udacity line by line to see what I can learn from them and try to see whether I can improve these codes in some way. I had commented places where I made changes and you can ignore them if you do not like.

The reason why I can post them here is Udacity is so generous that it already open-sourced all of the code materials here and also encouraged us to submit our projects assignments via Github. As an effort to emphasis the Udacity's contribution, I delete almost every files which are not necessary for my own settings to work. To make the codes run properly, you only need to download or git clone the original Udacity repository, setup the environment accordingly and put all the files in the same project folder.

I am posting up my assignment solutions and some other codes I practiced and found useful to document my learnings and hopefully, you may find them beneficial as well. However, if you are also a student enrolling this program, please do not directly copy the answer here. You are learning something which will accompany you for the rest of your life. Don't be lured by the seemingly easier path. Go get headaches yourself and when you are done, comparing mine or Udacity's solution to uncover different solutions for the same problem.The very skills of problem-solving are the things we need to excel in any aspects of life.

I finished this course within 4 months and was the 2nd person of my cohort. The process itself is a great reward and I will continue learning and have fun!
